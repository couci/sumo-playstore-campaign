### Resources you can request

For this event you can request up to 30 USD. Please note that you can only apply for the budget after the event happens. To do so, fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSckdqfnixYhk5D9YLNEPOWSYbl4c6WfBiFpvWTKfRBhAaZ6XA/viewform?usp=sf_link">request budget form</a> and provide the link to your receipts.
